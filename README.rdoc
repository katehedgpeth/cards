== Texas Holdem Simulator

A silly little card game simulator I started building while on vacation, inspired by a programming challenge on reddit. This app selects a random number of players to begin the game with, and deals everyone two cards. You see your own cards but no one else's. At this point, the only thing you can do is bet once and see the flop. I'd like to add more features at some point, such as:


- Ability to play a full hand and start a new one (and have the dealer button move around the table)
- Ability to continuation-bet in each round of betting (i.e. re-raise if someone raises you)
- Ability to guess your pot odds at each round and see if you're correct, and maybe measure your accuracy
- Players will come and go from the table after each hand
